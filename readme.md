# Poorly designed typetester

#### Build and run:
```console
: make
: ./build/main
```

Also, in order to make it work you have to specify correct path to "dictionary" directory. Then you should place there a file called ***default.txt*** with words you want to train. The file is read line-by-line, so it is expected to be one word in one line.

Personally, I am using *google-10000-english*.
